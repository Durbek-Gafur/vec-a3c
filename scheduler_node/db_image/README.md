VS Code indeed provides an option to check and change the encoding of a file. Here are the steps you can follow to inspect and convert the file to UTF-8 encoding:

Open the SQL dump file in VS Code.

In the lower right corner of the VS Code window, you should see an indicator of the current encoding. It might say "UTF-8", "UTF-16", or something similar.

Click on the encoding indicator. A list of options related to encoding will open at the top of the VS Code window.

Click on the first option, "Reopen with Encoding", and then select "UTF-8".

Now, the file has been reopened with UTF-8 encoding, but VS Code may not have saved it in that encoding yet. To save the file in UTF-8 encoding, click on the encoding indicator again, select "Save with Encoding", and then select "UTF-8".

After these steps, your file should be saved in UTF-8 encoding. Now, you can try using it again in your Docker container.

Please note that if there are any binary NULL characters or other non-ASCII characters in your SQL dump file, changing the encoding may not solve the issue. In that case, you might need to recreate the SQL dump file, as I mentioned in the previous message.
